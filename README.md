# Neural-Network-Model-From-Scratch

Neural Network Machine Learning Model Implemented from scratch

Overview: 
A project that shows how to build a neural network from basic principles only using the libraries numpy and pandas. The purpose is to create an internal understanding of these kinds of networks by making one ourselves without relying on high-level machine learning frameworks. 

Objective of the project:
The Main aim would be implementing a neural network from scratch and testing it with MNIST data set.

Project steps:

 1-Design the architecture of the neural network having input, hidden, and output layers based off from specified input-output shapes.

 2- Define an activation function (Sigmoid).

 3- Implement feedforward process where we send input through our network so as get output.

 4- Backpropagation algorithm is implemented which adjusts weights depending on error made by network output.

 5- Training and testing functions are also implemented so that training can be done on a given data set while its performance will be evaluated using another set known as test data.

 6- MNIST dataset models testing is done at this stage after having implemented everything else

 7- Confusion matrix should be calculated and displayed here.

 8- Accuracy of the model is computed and reported.
